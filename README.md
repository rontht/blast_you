# Blast You by Thwin

Blast You is a web app created for an assignment project for a course from Griffith University.
The project was made on VSC (Visual Studio Code) and built using P5.js. 
P5.js library is already included in the source code.
Users may use this web app by opening via live server on the index.html file.
